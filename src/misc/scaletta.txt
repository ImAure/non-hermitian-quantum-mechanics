NON-HERMITIAN QUANTUM MECHANICS

==> Introduction
    ->> Brief history?
    ->> Hermitian operators as observable quantities
    ->> Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real eigenvalues
    ->> The case of PT-Symmetric Hamiltonians

==> Hermiticity in "classical" QM
    ->> Postulates of QM 
    ->> Hermitian operators and their Properties
        --> reality of eigenvalues, orthonormality of eigenspaces, unitarity of time evolution
    ->> Examples?

==> P and T Operators
    ->> Definition of P and T
    ->> Main properties of P and T
        --> Action on Lorentz' group(?), Px, Pp, Tx, Tp ...
        --> Other properties: P^2 = T^2 = 1...
        --> Reality of eigenvalues
    ->> PT operator
        --> PT symmetry

==> PT-Symmetric Hamiltonians
    ->> PT-Symmetric Hamiltonians and inner product/completenes
    ->> The C operator and CPT inner product
    ->> Unitarity of PT Symmetric QM

==> Examples and applications
    ->> PT Harmonic oscillator (... + x^2(ix)^e)
    ->> More examples? Matrix Hamiltonian 

==> Conclusions?
    ->> Hermiticity is sufficient but not necessity
